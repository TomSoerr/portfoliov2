## Description

In this project from “The Odin Project” I create a Tic Tac Toe Web-App with
JavaScript. You can play against a computer. In the
JavaScript Code, I use Function Factories and IIFE's. <br>
This project has:

- a menu with:
  - a name input,
  - two icon radio button,
  - a difficulty dropdown,
  - a round dropdown and
  - a start button and
- a game page with:
  - a board,
  - a info box and
  - a menu button.

There are three difficulties. Easy, Medium and Hard.
The easy difficulty picks a random cell.
The medium and hard difficulties use the minimax algorithm.
