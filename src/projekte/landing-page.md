# My “Landing-Page” Project

## Description

In this second project of “The Odin Project” I create a landing page with HTML and CSS. <br>
This project has:

- a fixed header,
- a footer with contact information and
- three sections which describe company.

For the layout I used flexbox and the landing page would be suitable for a bike shop.
