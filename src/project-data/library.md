# My “Library” Project

## Description
In this project from “The Odin Project” I build a small library app.  <br>
This app can:
- add a book to the library,
- delete a book from the library,
- sort the library by:
  - reading status,
  - title,
  - author,
  - pages and
  - when it was added to the library.

If the page is reloaded, the library is not lost.
