# My “Calculator” Project

## Description
In this project from “The Odin Project” I create a calculator web app. <br>
The calculator can:
- add,
- subtract,
- multiply,
- divide,
- delete the last number,
- clear the whole calculation,
- and calculate float numbers.

There is also key tracking and a list of numbers can be calculated in a row.
