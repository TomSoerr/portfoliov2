# My “Rock, Paper, Scissors” Project

## Description
In this project from “The Odin Project” I create a “Rock, Paper, Scissors” web application.

This project has:
- a slide that asks the user if he wants to play,
- a slide that defines the rules, 
- a game slide with buttons for each weapon and a point meter,
- a computer to play against,
- and a slide to play again.

The first one to reach 5 points wins.
