# My “Weather App” Project

## Description
In this project from “The Odin Project” I create a simple weather app with
the api from openweathermap.org<br>
This project has:

- a search bar that allows the user to search for a city,
- a fahrenheit/celsius toggle button,
- a current weather card and
- a forecast card.

The forecast is for one day.

## Notes
I use the free Current Weather, 3-hour Forecast 5 days, and Geocoding APIs 
from openweathermap.org. 

If there are any legal issues please contact me.

The icons are by myself.
