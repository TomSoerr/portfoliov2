# My “Etch a Sketch” Project

## Description
In this project from “The Odin Project” I create a painting web application only with JS DOM Manipulation. The canvas consists only of div boxes. <br>
This project has the following features:
- change the background,
- change the color of the pen,
- a bucket/fill tool,
- an eraser,
- choose a random color for each pixel,
- put a shadow or a lightening over a color or the background,
- turn a grid on and off,
- select a new resolution for the canvas and
- clean the canvas.

## Notes
If you want to,  you can use the icons. They are made by myself.
