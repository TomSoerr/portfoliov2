# My “Todo List” Project

## Description
In this project from “The Odin Project” I create a Todo List Web-Application <br>
This Todo App can:

- create new Todos in different projects,
- show all Todos,
- show Todos of today,
- show Todos of this week,
- show Todos of the current project.

All Todos and project are stored in the local storage.
On a page refresh nothing is lost.
